Michael Hill International Cash Flow & DCF Model

****

Project Overview

This financial model evaluates Michael Hill International using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation, following a real-world case study. 
The scenario is based on Michael Hill's significant 50% share price decline due to its exit from the U.S. market and Emma & Roe stores. 
The company's management believes it is now undervalued and has called in analysts to determine its fair value and strategic options.

Valuation Methods Used

Three core valuation methods were considered:

1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis – Estimates the company's intrinsic value based on the present value of its future expected cash flows, discounted at its cost of capital.

2. Comparable Company Analysis (Comps) – Compares Michael Hill to similar publicly traded firms using valuation multiples such as P/E, EV/EBITDA, and P/S ratios.

3. Precedent Transactions Analysis – Uses past mergers and acquisitions of similar companies to determine a fair market price based on deal multiples.

Step-by-Step DCF Valuation Process

1. Project Future Cash Flows

    * Estimated Unlevered Free Cash Flows (UFCF) over the next 5–10 years

    * Considered revenue growth, operating costs, taxes, CapEx, and working capital changes

2. Determine the Discount Rate

    * Used the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) to discount future cash flows

    * Factored in company risk and expected investor returns

3. Estimate Terminal Value

    * Used two methods to calculate the company's terminal value:

    * Gordon Growth Model (assumes steady future growth)

    * Exit Multiple Method (applies industry valuation multiples)

4. Discount Cash Flows to Present Value

    * Converted future cash flows into today’s dollar value using WACC as the discount rate

5. Calculate Enterprise & Equity Value

    * Summed up the discounted cash flows & terminal value to get the Enterprise Value (EV)

    * Subtracted debt and added cash to estimate Equity Value

    * Divided by shares outstanding to calculate intrinsic stock price
